## Server side Calculator

A server side calculator that is able to take in two inputs and a operator and display the results. calculator will keep a detailed list of all previous equations.

I ran into the problem of converting a "+" to be used as an actual operator rather then in a string: I ended up just writing if else statements to go around this problem.

another issue i ran into was trying to push the equation and the total to the object array: I ended up pushing them to a new object then pushing that object into the object array
